This program was created for a Software Engineer Test at FetchRewards. It will check if a given word is a Pyramid word 
or not. e.g.

>BANANA is a pyramid word where 'B' occurs 1 time, 'N' occurs 2 times, 'A' occurs 3 times (1,2,3)

>BANDANA is a not pyramid word as 'B' occurs 1 time, 'D' occurs 1 time, 'N' occurs 2 times, 'A' occurs 3 times (1,1,2,3)

To run this project, Right click Pyramid.java and click Run.

Additional test strings can be added under the main method using the following statement:
```
    assertTrue(isPyramid(countOccurrencesOfUniqueCharacters(<INSERT_TEST_STRING_HERE>))); 
```
